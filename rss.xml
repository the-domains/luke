            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Summer Writing</h1>,<p>Luke Kosner // Summer Writing</p>,<p>The summer started somewhat sadly. I didn't know it was my last time seeing Jack T at school for a couple years, I was also the last person to see him. After that I went indoor skydiving with Ian. Then I went to my coding camp for two weeks, it was fun and then I went to Turks and Caicos with my brother and sister were both there which was a special treat. which was really really fun! Then we went to Miami two days after for the MLB All-Star which was also very fun. Then later in the month we also went to Amelia Island, Florida for my grandfathers 80th birthday also incredibly awesome. And the grand jewel, Montauk. Unfortunately my sister, Grace, was not able to come, but my brother, Walter and his girlfriend, Maddie, were able to come. But we had a fun time going to pancakes, donuts, lobster, salad, chicken and others. I also had sleepovers with Luke B and Andrew A.</p>]]></description>
